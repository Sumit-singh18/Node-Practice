We basically put the whole big.file content in memory before we wrote it out to the response object. This is very inefficient.

The HTTP response object (res in the code above) is also a writable stream. This means if we have a readable stream that represents the content of big.file, we can just pipe those two on each other and achieve mostly the same result without consuming ~400 MB of memory.

Node’s fs module can give us a readable stream for any file using the createReadStream method. We can pipe that to the response object:
